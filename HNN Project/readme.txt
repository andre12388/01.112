Instruction on how to run the code:

1. run the part2.py, part3.py, and part4.py in sequence from 2 to 4
2. after that, all necessary emission params, transition params, and dev.out files will be created
3. open cmd, traverse to the directory where evalResult.py is stored under 'data' folder
4. enter the following command for 'cn' and 'part2' specific result evaluation: python evalResult.py cn/dev.out cn/dev.p2.out
5. to see other evaluation, you can change the 'cn' to 'en','fr', or 'sg' and the 'p2' to 'p3', or 'p4'
