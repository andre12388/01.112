# 01.112: Machine Learning

Machine learning is the study of algorithms that improve their performance at some task with experience. 
In this course, students will learn how machine learning has led to many innovative real-world applications. 
The students will also gain an in-depth understanding of a broad range of machine learning algorithms from basic to state-of-the-art, 
such as: na√Øve Bayes, logistic regression, neural networks, clustering, probabilistic graphical models, reinforcement learning and SVMs.
